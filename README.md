Tests made with OpenCV software to learn how to make an automated shopping mall queue alert with computer vision.

This folder contains couple tests when I learned to use python and OpenCV. 
There is a primitive face and phone recognition algorithms using laptops frontcamera.
The queue alert uses raspberrypi and a fisheye camera to simulate embedded environment and wide lense cameras used in shopping malls.

Framecompare_roi starts video capture, gets a still frame from the video feed and converts it to greyscale.
The python program checks changes against the still frame and gives a percentage of the change happened.
Gives also visual feedback with greyscale video.


Go to framecompare_roi folder:
1. Run framecompare_roi.py
2. Press i to take the still frame and start comparison.
3. Quit with q.
